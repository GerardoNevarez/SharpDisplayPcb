ZIF connector

Adafruit used: Molex 52892-1095
obsoleted, Mouser suggested: Molex 52892-1033
footprint compatible!  but Molex now says: New Business Not Supported
and recommends: Molex 505278-1033, which has a different footprint
and is a bit cheaper, enough to cover the cost of PCBs at JLC

Oh...  and Sharp recommended Molex: 51441-1093... which is also obsolete.
replacement recommended is also 505278-1033
